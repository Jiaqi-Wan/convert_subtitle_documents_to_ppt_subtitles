This is a python script to turn subtitle Word documents to PPT documents, as for running a show,we always use PPT to roll our subtitles.For many times,I have seen many operators copy and paste each sentence from Word to PPT,which cost too much time.So I have written a python script to automatically turn subtitle Word documents to PPT documents to sve time.(BTW I am not sure how many show operators have Python IDE and look through this Github hhh)

Step1:Please make sure you have Python IDE.

Step2:Open"字幕测试.ppt"，click View -> the master -> edit the front,size,color to what you need.(Please make sure you choose the color by yourself,not the system)

Step3:Open your Word document,and add"/"in the end of the sentence(Please test the longest letters you can have in your screen,and donnot over this number to make sure you can successfully display the whole sentence in your screen)

Step4:Open this Python script,and only need to edit the document's path at last.

Step5:RUN!

PS If you donnot want to use Python script,you can choose one ready-developed application:Glypheo(but sadly only for MacOS,click this link to download:https://www.glypheo.com/#download)
